# distributionsMatter
Short jupyter notebook showcasing how using different distributions, namely CSDA energy distribution and a gaussian distribution, will yield different images with perceivable differences

nergyDistr.ipynb contains the code for generating the images and Plots.ipynb calls the plots from the plotly cloud and described the steps. At the moment the plots are not rendered on Github.
