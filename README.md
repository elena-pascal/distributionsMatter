# distributionsMatter
Short jupyter notebook showcasing how using different distributions, namely CSDA energy distribution and a gaussian distribution, will yield different images with perceivable differences

* _energyDistr.ipynb_ contains the code for generating the images 
* _Plots.ipynb_ calls the plots from the plotly cloud and described the steps. 

At the moment the plots in the _Plots.ipynb_ are rendered only by using nbvirewer option (top right button)
